# Oussama-Ajala-Repo
Data mining Repo

My name is Oussama Ajala I attend Catawba College, I major in Information System and Technology.

Some of my skills are Python, Java, and IT based work.



My high school experience was at Forestview High School, and now I attend  Catawba college to get a degree in ITS.

I haven’t worked on any projects on the platform yet but will be adding them as I work on these.

My current experiences yet include mostly just Programming classes, data classes, and management classes at Catawba college.
